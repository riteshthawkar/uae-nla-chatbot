					<description><![CDATA[The book depicts aspects of the history of the eastern and southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula, including Oman and the Trucial States, now known as the UAE, from prehistoric times through several historic eras, and the life-style of the inhabitants of this region. Chapters of the book focus on the development of the Trucial States, now known as the UAE. The book notes that the UAE has witnessed great transformation since the discovery of oil.

The country has transformed from a traditional society into a modern one, but due to its people's keen interest in their history, the country's past is still vivid in their memory. The book recounts the amazing story of how the Emirates and its ruling families transformed from a tribal society into a modern and sophisticated state. It describes the facts of life in the Emirates since the dawn of history, the advent of Islam, the emergence of the Bani Yas tribe and the relocation of Sheikh Shakhbut bin Dhiyab's residence to Abu Dhabi in 1795, the history of Al- Qawasim tribe and flourishing of trade in Dubai.

The book also monitors the ups and downs of the country's history, the boom and decline of the pearl industry, and the conditions of the Trucial Coast during World War II. It details the oil discovery stage and the political and environmental lifestyles during the Trucial States phase (1945-1968), which quickly led to the federation of the Emirates, giving the UAE a high-ranking status among the most prosperous and flourishing countries in the world. The book also sheds light on the early signs of the union and the establishment of the UAE, and the continuous development taking place in the UAE.

The author asserts that the United Arab Emirates has in fifty years achieved progress and development, which major industrial countries have ever achieved in three hundred years.]]></description>
