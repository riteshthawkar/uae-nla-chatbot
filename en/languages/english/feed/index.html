					<description><![CDATA[The book documents the efforts of the founding leader Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, and his remarkable genius in transforming the land of the Emirates from a barren desert into lush green gardens; thus documenting his agricultural and environmental thinking, which is a practical reflection of his words: “give me agriculture I assure you of civilization”

In the foreword, HH Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Presidential Affairs and Chairman of the National Library and Archives wrote: “Thanks to the vision and wisdom of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE has emerged as the environmental capital of the world.

					<description><![CDATA[يصف الكتاب أعمال شركة الهند البريطانية للملاحة البخارية وتجارتها في منطقة الخليج العربي على مدار 120 عاماً، وكيف أسهمت في تطوير المنطقة.
ويشير الكتاب إلى أن العرب قد عرفوا ظاهرة الرياح الموسمية منذ القدم، ونقلوا معارفهم إلى البحّارة في كل أصقاع الأرض، وأُسّست منظومة تجارية تمتد من إفريقية إلى الهند والشرق الأقصى، شملت تجاراً بضاعتهم تشتمل على مختلف السلع.
ويتوقف الكتاب في عام 1830 حين كتبت صحيفة "لندن ريفيو" البريطانية عن عنصر جديد حلّ محل الرياح، وكان ذلك العنصر هو المحرك البخاري الذي يُسيّر البواخر التي تستطيع أن تحدد جداولها الزمنية بشكل مستقل عن الرياح والمدّ والجزر.
ويسرد الكتاب مراحل تطور السفن البخارية وما كانت تقدمه من خدمات، ويرصد التدخل الأجنبي، وأخطار البحر، وواقع الناس والتجارة في الخليج العربي، ثم يصف ما بلغته شركة الهند البريطانية للملاحة البخارية في الخليج العربي.]]></description>

The book sheds lights on the discovery and development of offshore oil fields in the UAE, and monitors the emergence of offshore oil industry from its early beginnings until modern operations, and the accompanying human stories. The author states that the discovery of oil came at the right time for the Trucial Coast as it brought a new source of wealth that replaced the old one, pearl.This wealth has exceeded all expectations and promptly turned the UAE into modern cities and regional commercial centers. The author notes that much has been written about the search for onshore oil, but offshore oil has not received enough attention from writers, in spite of the fact that modern oil industry has reached the high seas in less than a century, and it has its own characteristics and challenges. Moreover, it has contributed greatly to the UAE economy. The book consists of eight chapters enhanced by a large number of photos, drawings, maps, appendices, terminology and references.

					<description><![CDATA[In the introduction to his book Emiratis: All Our Yesterdays, a combined translated version of this recent publication of the National Archives (NA), Rundell’s objective is to ‘recreate’ or rather ‘recollect’ the atmosphere and circumstances of the early 1960s during which he served with the Trucial Oman Scouts (TOS). In the foreword to the combined English-Arabic volume, HH Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Presidential Affairs and Chairman of the NCDR, has noted that the author “dedicated the book to the young generation of Emiratis to show them what a noble tradition they had inherited from their ancestors who rose above all hardships with a very distinct personal dignity.” As a Desert Intelligence Officer, Rundell was personally and officially involved in the day-to-day affairs of the Trucial States (as the UAE was known prior to the Federation). While stressing the prominent role played by the oil wealth in the transformation process that has produced today’s United Arab Emirates, Rundell pinpoints the deeper reasons for this dramatic change, mainly a sense of responsibility on the part of the Rulers, and in particular the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan. The myriad photographs filling the 200-page book depict contemporary events and personalities significantly adding to the rare and vintage value of the narrative.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This book is a documentary record covering an important era in the history of Arabia; namely the era of prospecting for oil and the early production of what came to be termed Black Gold, which has brought about significant changes in the pattern of life in the region. The documents in the book are photographs taken by the author’s father, Mike Morton, during his stay in Arabia and his work there as a geologist for different oil companies from 1947 to 1954. The book deals with various aspects of life and work in the desert while prospecting for oil in an area where the frankincense trade played a pivotal role. The author was keen on revealing how oil prospecting operations have also yielded pioneering geographical exploration works of which the West had no or little knowledge. In turn, such explorations have since revealed a wealth of anthropological information. Many of the photographs included in the book depict the people who lived and worked in the heart of the vast desert, their style of life, dwellings, oases, means of transportation (including camels and ships), customs and traditions, and sources of sustenance (including fishing and pearl diving), food and drink, villages and towns, and system of government (tribes and rulers). Black Gold and Frankincense is a welcome and valuable addition to the literature on a very strategic period in the region’s history.]]></description>
