The author lived through a critical era that witnessed transformations affecting the Arab region and the world. Against its own will, the Arab World was a stage for some of those conflicts. As Prince Abdulla, he managed to convince his father, Al Shareef Al Hussein Bin Ali, to respond favourably to Arab demands and to declare a revolution that would realize the aspirations of the nation: liberty, sovereignty and independence.
