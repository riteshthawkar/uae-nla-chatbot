Linking the past with the present, the fort stands today as the most illustrious symbol of their achievements. Set against the historic backdrop of Qasr Al Hosn, this book provides a well-researched and balanced account of almost 200 years of Abu Dhabi\u2019s history. The narrative focuses on the 11 Al Bu Falah Rulers who ruled the Emirate from 1793 to 1966. The study examines in detail the several forces and factors which paved the way for the emergence of Abu Dhabi as the paramount political and economic power on the Gulf Coast. This was also the period of growing British control over the coastal Emirates and the book analyzes all aspects of British policy-making. The socio-economic conditions that transformed the character of Abu Dhabi have also been depicted as they provide interesting glimpses into the traditional economy, society and life-style of the region. The book, published in both Arabic &amp; English, also contains copies of important documents hitherto unpublished, some rare photographs of Abu Dhabi and a unique genealogical tree of the Al Nahyan Ruling Family which should serve as invaluable references for scholars and researchers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For nearly two centuries, Qasr Al Hosn served as the fortress, royal residence and administrative headquarters of the Al Bu Falah Rulers, the ancestors of the Al Nahyan Ruling Family of Abu Dhabi.
