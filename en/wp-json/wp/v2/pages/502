By devoting special attention to history, a nation gains valuable lessons that guide its quest for progress and prosperity.<br \/>\nSafeguarding historical documents for future generations is one of the most important responsibilities of a sovereign, enlightened state, and advancement in archiving is the ideal way for a nation to preserve its heritage, reinforce the concept of institutionalization and enhance national identity. This also inspires patriotism, as archives preserve the memories and historical records of the nation.<br \/>\nThe National Library And Archives in Abu Dhabi is a pioneer among archival institutions, acquainting the public with the history, people, land and heritage of the United Arab Emirates in particular and the Arabian Peninsula in general. The National Library And Archives has undertaken the responsibility of performing its fundamental obligations in researching and analyzing the sources of the nation&#8217;s history. The keen interest that Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, Late President of the UAE, had shown in the history of his country and his desire to provide Emiratis with the tools to preserve their history and learn from past experiences, were the basis for the establishment of the National Archives. The National Library And Archive has therefore acquired copies of documents from international archives pertaining specifically to the UAE and the Arab Gulf. These archives contain a wealth of historical materials that shed light on many aspects of life in the area dating back to the 16th century.<br \/>\nThe National Library And Archive has become a hub for all seekers of knowledge bearing on the history and development of the UAE and the Arab Gulf. I am confident that this growing National Library And Archive will remain a pioneering institution, embracing all efforts to expand our knowledge of history and culture.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr class=\"m-0 pb-1 \" \/>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deputy Prime Minister And Minister Of Presidential Affairs&#8217; Message His Highness Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan&#8217;s Message UAE Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Of The Presidential Court Awareness of history and its events is a keystone of civilization.
