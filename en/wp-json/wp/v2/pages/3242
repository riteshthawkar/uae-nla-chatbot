He learned from his father about the glorious past of the Qawasem and was impressed by their heroic history. He was taught by a lady Mutawa \u201creligious instructor\u201d named Fatima, and he learned verses of Quran and hadith at a very early age. He was religious and learnt reading and writing and his upbringing was of an Arab and Islamic nature. He was interested in teaching his children the values and tenets of Islam. He was famous for his intelligence, composure and adherence to the true Arab customs and traditions. He was immensely proud of his ancestors who built the largest Arab maritime force in the region, and was well known for his loyalty to the Arab nation and for his support for the causes of peace and goodwill.<br \/>\nHe took up the reins of government in July 17, 1948 after the abdication of his uncle Sheikh Sultan Bin Salem. Since that date, he worked hard to lay down the foundations of national unity among the tribes of his region and managed to bring them together. He sought to develop his Emirate economically, socially and culturally. He was close to his citizens and shared with them their daily life, their gatherings and celebrations. He was keen on developing his Emirate, especially as far as education and literacy are concerned, because he believed in the role of education in building men and women, as well as the society and in shaping the cultural awareness of nations. Thus, he promoted education, built modern schools, and made education compulsory for girls and boys alike. He offered material and moral incentives to students and their parents. He established the Department of Education to follow up scholarship programs in the Emirate. The Late Sheikh Saqr was also interested in providing comprehensive healthcare to Ras Al Khaimah citizens. Hence, he opened the Kuwaiti Hospital. In fact, during his reign three modern hospitals were opened.<br \/>\nHe was involved in establishing the Union together with his fellow Rulers of the other Emirates. Thus on February 10, 1972, H.H. announced the accession of Ras Al Khaimah to the United Arab Emirates. Consequently, a unified and strong political entity has come into existence, a state that is able to face up to the region\u2019s challenges and forge a strong bond amongst all the Emiratis.<br \/>\nH.H. Sheikh Saqr Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi declared on that day: \u201cAs we are building a Union in this part of our great Arab World, it would only be a brick in the edifice of the Arab Nation that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf\u201d.<br \/>\nDevelopment and construction projects in Ras Al Khaimah kicked off with the laying of the basis of a proper government administration and building the organizational, financial and administrative institutions, in addition to governmental departments and agencies that oversee the implementation of such development projects. The urban and economic renaissance continued under H.H.\u2019s directives and supervision. In 1976, Ras Al Khaimah Airport was inaugurated and in 1977, Saqr Port was opened. Ras Al Khaimah witnessed great achievements in a few years during his reign and saw quantum leaps towards progress and prosperity.<br \/>\nModern plans based on contemporary principles were devised to establish several vital facilities in the Emirate. Ras Al Khaimah made great achievements by building all vital facilities. During his reign, the Emirate attracted many successful industries that helped achieve further progress including the cement, pharmaceutical, ceramics and steel industries.<br \/>\nSheikh Saqr Bin Mohamed Al Qasimi passed away on October 27, 2010. He was the last to pass away of the founding fathers of the UAE, which was established in 1971. His son Sheikh Saud Bin Saqr succeeded him and continued his father\u2019s journey of giving and caring.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1920-2010 Full Name: Saqr Bin Mohammed Bin Salem Bin Sultan Bin Saqr Bin Rashid Bin Rahma Bin Matar Bin Kayed Al Qasimi Duration of his Rule: 62 years The late Sheikh Saqr Bin Mohammed was born in the city of Ras Al Khaimah in 1920 and was raised by his father Sheikh Mohammed Bin Salem [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":60,"featured_media":3243,"parent":416,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"templates\/template-with-banner.php","meta":{"inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3242"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/60"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3242"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3242\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15796,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3242\/revisions\/15796"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/416"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3243"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.nla.ae\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3242"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
